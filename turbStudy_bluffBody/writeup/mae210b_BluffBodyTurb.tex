\lettrine{B}{odies} When a body moves in a fluid, it experience different forces, such as lift and drag. Drag can occur due to a difference in velocity in the surface of the body and the mean flow, in which case we call it friction drag. This friction is associated with the development of boundary layers and is it scales with the Reynolds number. If the drag is due to a difference in pressure trough the surface of the body, then we call it pressure drag or viscous induced drag. This drag is usually associated with separation of the flow and the formation of a wake downstream the body. In real flows, drag is composed by the combination of both. The effect of frictional drag is usually more relevant for attached flows while the pressure drag prevails in separated flows. 

We can analyze the effect of friction and pressure drag by analyzing the flow around a flat plate. If the flat plate is oriented in the direction of the flow, then the friction drag will be important while the pressure drag will be almost negligible. On the other side, if the orient the flat plate perpendicular to the flow, then the difference of pressure between both sides of the plate will be much more important than the effect of the friction, and so the pressure drag will be dominant.

When the drag of a body is dominated by viscous drag, we define the body as a streamlined body. Flat plates (oriented in the direction of the flow) or  airfoils with a small angle of attack are examples of those. When the flow is dominated by pressure drag, we define the body as a bluff or blunt body. Examples or these are squares, cylinders, spheres or airfoil at large angle of attack. Whether a body is considered bluff or streamlined is only a function of its shape and its orientation with respect to the flow.
